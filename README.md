# Credit Score Classification Project
A complete, reproducible workflow that goes from data cleaning and modeling in Python, to SQL-based EDA for original vs. predicted credit scores, and Tableau dashboards for executiveâ€‘level storytelling.
# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer financial and demographic data to classify credit scores and identify factors that influence them.

The dataset contains features such as age, bank accounts, loans, payment history, and annual income.

I explored the data, cleaned and prepared it, performed feature selection, and built a Random Forest Classifier to predict credit scores.

In addition, I created Tableau dashboards to visualize key trends and patterns, providing both business insights and model interpretability.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and uncover patterns.
Handle missing values, outliers, and negative values in financial metrics.
Engineer meaningful features for modeling.
Reduce features using statistical tests (ANOVA, Chi-Square, VIF) and feature importance.
Train and evaluate a Random Forest Classifier to predict credit scores.
Create interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize findings.
Discuss model performance and potential business use cases.
