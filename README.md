# Credit Score Classification Project
A complete, reproducible workflow that goes from data cleaning and modeling in Python, to SQL-based EDA for original vs. predicted credit scores, and Tableau dashboards for executive‑level storytelling.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[Credit Score Classification Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/...](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification)).

# 📌 Project Overview
- This project focuses on analyzing customer financial and demographic data to classify credit scores and identify factors that influence them.
- The dataset contains features such as age, bank accounts, loans, payment history, and annual income.
- I explored the data, cleaned and prepared it, performed feature selection, and built a Random Forest Classifier to predict credit scores.
- In addition, I created Tableau dashboards to visualize key trends and patterns, providing both business insights and model interpretability.

# 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and uncover patterns.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and negative values in financial metrics.
- Engineer meaningful features for modeling.
- Reduce features using statistical tests (ANOVA, Chi-Square, VIF) and feature importance.
- Train and evaluate a Random Forest Classifier to predict credit scores.
- Create interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize findings.
- Discuss model performance and potential business use cases.
